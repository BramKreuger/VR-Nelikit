Let me tell you the story of Nelikit.
There were two brothers, Aka and Gugak. They were Giants.
They were one of the first to exist on this earth. Aka went up and Gugak went down. Aka saw that everything was good up. He went down to visit Gugak on the land and asked, what is the condition of your land?
The soil in my area is good, it can be poetic and it can stop, it rhymes like the sound of a waterfall.
One rainy day Gugak went for a walk. The ancients bemoaned him, they needed him to stay at the waterfall and take care of it. 
Aka, went walking and found a river, with a lot of fish. He said, if you throw a fish bone in the river, then the fish will live. Even rivers are good at poetry.
If you want to look for them, you have to throw the Telikit into the air, so that we know that you wan to find us and we will be. 
Welcome to VR-Nelikit.
Here is how it works: Use the trigger on your middle finger to grab objects.
To catch the Telikit, point your blowpipe to the middle of the Telikit when it's mid-air and close enough. And and use your index finger to try and catch.
To restart the game press the B button on your right controller.
Any other interactions are done by pointing the controller and pressing trigger with your index finger.
Good luck and have fun!
